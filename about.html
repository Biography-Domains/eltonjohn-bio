                <p>Sir Elton Hercules John CH CBE (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight, 25 March 1947) is an English singer, pianist, and composer. Collaborating with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967 on more than 30 albums, John has sold over 300 million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits in the UK Singles Chart and US Billboard Hot 100, including nine number ones in the US and seven in the UK. His tribute single "Candle in the Wind 1997", rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33 million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts.</p><p>Born in Pinner, Middlesex, John learned to play piano at an early age and by the mid-1960s was playing with Bluesology. He met Taupin in 1967 after they both answered an advertisement for songwriters. For two years they wrote songs for other artists, and John also worked as a session musician. In 1969, John released his first album, Empty Sky. In 1970, he released his second album, Elton John, which contained his first hit, "Your Song", which reached number seven in the UK and number eight in the US. His breakthrough came with the 1972 album Honky Château, which reached number one in the US. Throughout the 1970s, John was a dominant force in the music industry, releasing a string of successful albums and singles. He became known for his flamboyant stage persona, wearing outrageous costumes and performing energetic concerts. Some of his most famous songs from this period include "Rocket Man", "Crocodile Rock", "Tiny Dancer", "Daniel", and "Bennie and the Jets".</p><p>In the 1980s, John continued to release successful albums and singles, although his sound evolved, incorporating elements of pop and new wave. He overcame struggles with substance abuse and personal issues, ultimately achieving sobriety. He has also been a staunch advocate for AIDS awareness and LGBTQ+ rights.</p><p>John's musical style is rooted in rock and roll and blues but has also incorporated elements of pop, gospel, country, and classical music. His piano playing is a defining characteristic of his sound, and his songwriting partnership with Bernie Taupin is one of the most successful in music history. Taupin provides the lyrics, and John composes the music, often writing the melody very quickly after reading the lyrics.</p><p>Elton John's achievements are numerous. He has won five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, and a Kennedy Center Honor. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998 for services to music and charitable services. His impact on popular music is undeniable, and his songs continue to be popular with audiences of all ages.</p><p>His Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, which began in 2018 and concluded in 2023, became one of the highest-grossing concert tours of all time, solidifying his legacy as a global superstar. He continues to be a major figure in music and philanthropy.</p>
